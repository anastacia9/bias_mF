These are output files from RNAeval.
1461 genes represented here (in alphabetical order); see the '273614N_mRNA.fa' file for order of gene names.
mfe structures are broken down into their comprising substructures and these substructures' deltaGs are given in these files.
Substructure deltaGs are in units of deca-cals/mol, where a deca-cal/mol = 10 cal/mol.
