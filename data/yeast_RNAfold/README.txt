stdout file from RNAfold; one file per isolate
These files were generated by RNAfold at 30C.
Entire mRNAs (both UTRs and CDS) were folded.
In the file for each isolate, gene names are preceded by an isolate-specific identifier, e.g. 'A0' for isolate 273614N.

The line below the mRNA sequence shows the mfe structure as well as the mfe deltaG in units of kcal/mol (see end of line).
The second line below the mRNA sequence shows the ensemble deltaG structure as well as the ensemble deltaG in units of kcal/mol.
