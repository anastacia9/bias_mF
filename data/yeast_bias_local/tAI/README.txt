For a given gene in a given isolate, domain_3 tAI is the tAI of its concatenated domain(s) and 3'coding sequences.
Linker_5 tAI is the tAI of the gene's concatenated linker(s) and 5'coding sequences.

Not all genes have a linker region. For those that do not, linker_5 tAI is just the tAI of the 5'coding sequence.
