Struc_frac method: (METHOD USED IN THESIS)
To compute the deltaG of an mRNA region (e.g. the coding sequence),
we first sum the deltaGs of all substructures completely enclosed within it.
Then, for any partially enclosed substructure, we
**1) calculate what fraction of the substructure is built by nucleotides from our region,
2) multiply this value by the substructure’s deltaG,
3) add the result to our existing sum

Sec_frac method:
To compute the deltaG of an mRNA region (e.g. the coding sequence),
we first sum the deltaGs of all substructures completely enclosed within it.
Then, for any partially enclosed substructure, we
**1) calculate what fraction of the nucleotides of our region of interest are bound up in this substructure
2) multiply this value by the substructure’s deltaG,
3) add the result to our existing sum
