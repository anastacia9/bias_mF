Herein we have tAI, ensemble deltaG, and PPR data for 1447 genes split into various groups.
Ensemble deltaG data is in units of kcal/mol.

1447 genes are ranked (low to high) by their median tAI values across isolates; we split this ranking in half.
1447 genes are again ranked (low to high) by their median ensemble deltaG values across isolates; we split this new ranking in half.

For each group of genes, we create three .csv files: one for tAI data, one for ensemble deltaG data, and one for PPR data.
