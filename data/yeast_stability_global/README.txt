Folding stability is calculated for the entire mRNA sequence (5'UTR + CDS + 3'UTR).
deltaG measures (ensemble and mfe) are in units of kcal/mol.
For each gene, base-pair probability was calculated as the mean of individual nucleotide pairing probabilities;
	the individual nucleotide pairing probabilities were calculated by RNAfold, but these files were
	unbelievably enormous so I deleted them - alas!
